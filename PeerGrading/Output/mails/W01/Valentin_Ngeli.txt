19. Maybe talk a little bit louder the rest was excellent
20. Tone a bit less autonomous
21. Very interesting and clear.
22. topic was well explained and you assessed some questions of OLAT!
23. He did a great job explaining the problem as well as addressing the question but, he could've added more visuals.
24. I found the presentation interesting and well presented. To improve further it would have been good with more interaction with the public.
25. Talk more into the mic, be more concise in your arguments
26. Simple and comprehensive presentation style
27. Great Presentation and clear slides.
28. He was a bit shy, i suppose. Presentation was quite simple, though explained everything.
29. a little bit uninspired and basic, there was not much content in the presentation.
30. I like that you adressed the Olat questions, the theory part could have been longer
31. Well spoken and you did a good job keeping the presentation interesting.
32. Great statisitical insight, good job at giving overview of topic. Speaking/presentation skills could be improved.
33. I felt the presentation could have been practiced more as the presentation was choppy.
34. good, clear presentation of the topic!
35. Being more interactive could be great. Overall, very good presentation.
36. Topic was clearly and well explained. I would have tried to make the presentation a little bit more interactive, but I reckon that isn’t easy with short limited time
37. very interesting topic and central to the actual context since everything is getting more expensive.
38. The presentation moves logically, it’s easy to follow and doesn’t feel random. Good use of research and relevant insights. Explain the regional differences more deeply, maybe by adding one sentence explaining why (cultural, regulatory, historical reasons)
39. Good eye contact, spoken freely
40. Numbers and percentages are good for the audience but some real life example could be nice as well. Also, I saw that studies show that WTP is there for sustainable products but it does't increase with "more" sustainable products. Meaning that as long as I pay more for a sustainable product, I wont pays 20% more for a 2x more sustainable product. That could have been interesting.
41. -
42. Perhaps it would have been interesting to include a real-life example or application.
