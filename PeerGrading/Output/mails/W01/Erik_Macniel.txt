6. Confidently presented with good slides
7. Real-Life Examples were nice, incorporating content from the lecture,

35. -
36. Great practical examples and insight into different countries
37. Presentation was a bit harder to follow, overall good.
38. Good presentation, with a red thread that was clear to follow. Maybe the presentation was a little bit too long.
39. maybe a bit too much on the slides for 5 minutes, but done really good!
40. Starting with Canadian Wollastonite is a strong choice, it makes the topic concrete and shows why disclosure actually matters in practice. Could avoid some repetition, like the idea of "disclosure is important" is repeated several times.
41. -
42. I liked the introduction, which included a real case study and explained the importance of the topic, and the conceptual takeaways at the end.

Best regards,
