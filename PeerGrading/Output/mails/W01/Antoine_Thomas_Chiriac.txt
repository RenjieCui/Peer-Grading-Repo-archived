36. Good structure of the presentation that was clear to follow, with an inspiring way of ending the presentation. The only thing I found unclear was if any questions from other students was answered or not.
37. Great job on the pacing and clarity of the subject, though some graphs were difficult to digest quickly and student questions needed clearer answers. Still, it was a very good presentation overall.
38. strong use of data and facts, as the presenter used concrete numbers and made a clear link to real word implications: he explained why minerals matter (EVs, energy transition). The intro is a bit dense, could start with one clear idea and then introduce 2 or 3 key minerals as examples.
39. Good presentation but a bit "plain"

41. -
42. I enjoyed the structure of the presentation and the clear issues and limitations that were set out.
